# The Script:
## Description :
the bash script that perform uni/bi CommsMatrix tests and rely on the conf file as an input to determine its behavior
## Logic :
![Alt Flow](./TestCommsMatrix.png?raw=true "Logic")
### Localhost execution :
1. basic validation:
    - is configuration file passed to the script as an argument
    - is the script running in compatible environment
    - is the configuration file has any duplicates blocks/attributes
2. install local dependencies 
    - install any required dependencies on localhost
3. write a script friendly configuration file
    - write another configuration file and fill any missing attributes with defaults if exist
4. start advanced validation 
    - check if any block missing an attribute
    - check attributes values if its valid 
    - check the accessibility and privileges on remote ips 
5. install dependencies on remote machines
    - install any required software on remote machines 
6. start generate tester/listeners scripts
    - read the conf file block by block and generate the required listeners/testers scripts
    - execute listeners scripts
    - once listener finished execution the testers start testing
7. create localtask for report/log gathering
    - once tester finish all testing vs all listeners the reports gathered to the localhost
    - once all testers in specific block finished testing the log gathering start
    - the csv updated 
### listerners execution:
    - if firewalld running will be stopped during ListenDuration
    - if target ports already open will not be touched
    - if targeted ports closed will be listening during the ListenDuration
    - logs Saved to will be saved ~[user]/CommsMatrix/[ConfFileName]-[Date]/Logs/Listening/
### Testers execution:
    - will not start scan a port range before making sure the range endport is listening
    - reports will be saved on ~[user]/CommsMatrix/[ConfFileName]-[Date]/Reports
    - logs will be saved ~[user]/CommsMatrix/[ConfFileName]-[Date]/Logs/Listening/
    - after the tester script finished execution will create the flag file at ~[user]/CommsMatrix/[ConfFileName]-[Date]/[BlockName]/Reports/[TesterIP]
## Prequiste :
    - remote-user    : have to be sudo with no passwd and authenticate with the public key

    - files get generated by the script for Scripts/troubleshooting/reporting/logging path:   [HOME]/CommsMatrixData/[ConfFileName]-[Date]/

# The Configuration File:
## description:
- hold multiple [block] to determine the script behavior
## blocks:
        - types:
           Default:   hold default attributes "Mode,User/s,ListenDuration" other attributes are now allowed
           [Others]:   hold specific attributes for the block including "Mode,User/s,ListenDuration,IPs,Ports," , block name is one string [a-zA-Z]
        - attributes:
            mode independent : can be used within [default] or any other [block]
                Mode: available values
                    uni :   one  way communication matrix test
                    bi  :   two way communication matrix test
                User:          the remote user
                UDPPorts:      mixed ranges/individual ports comma separated
                TCPPorts:      mixed ranges/individual ports comma separated
                ListentDurationInMinutes: port listen duration applied on tcp and udp ports on listeners
            mode dependant :
                            IPs: the remote ips , bi mode only
                            TestersIPs:      the remote testerip, uni mode only
                            ListenersIPs:    the remote listenerip , uni mode only
## Notes:
        - block name is one string [a-zA-Z]
        - hashed and empty lines in Configuration File ignored
        - any attribute does not match documented one ignored
        - configuration are validated for consistency and will exit if it is not consistent
        - IPs/TesterIPs/ListenerIPs:
                - the targeted ips can be mixed ranges/individual ips space or newline separated
                - the ip values are validated
                - range can be x.x.x.0-x.x.x.255 (right most)
                - IPS attribute is not allows in uni mode
                - TesterIPs/ListenersIPS attribute are not allowed in bi mode
        - listenduration used in :
            - basically for how long  tcp/udp kept open ports will
            - for how long firewall will be stopped
# To be Improved:
    - Remove the ListenDuration so firewall will keep open/ports will keep listening as long testing not finished
    - Run Commands when load average is not high
