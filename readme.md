The Script:
    description: the bash script that perform uni/bi CommsMatrix tests and relys on the conf file as input to determine the behavior
    logic :
       - localhost execution :
            - Read The Conf file and do validations
            - generate the scripts
            - execute Listeners and Testers Scripts via ssh&at on listeners
            - create a backgtound task on localhost  to:
                - check every 10 minutes if testers finished execution via checking the flagfile at  /tmp/CommsMatrix-<ConfFileName>-<BlockName>-<Date>-done
                - if flagfile exist the task will copy the reports to the localhost on ~<user>/CommsMatrix/<Date>/<ConfFileName>/<BlockName>/Reports/<TesterIP>
            - script exit
        - listerners execution:
            - make sure nmap-ncat is installed
            - if firewalld running will be stopped during Listenduration
            - if target ports already open will not be touched
            - if targeted ports closed will be listening during the ListenDuration
            - logs will be saved ~<user>/CommsMatrix/<Date>/<ConfFileName>/Logs/Listening/
        - Testers execution:
            - make sure nmap-ncat is installed
            - will not start scan a port range before making sure the range endport is listening
            - reports will be saved on ~<user>/CommsMatrix/<Date>/<ConfFileName>/Reports
            - logs will be saved ~<user>/CommsMatrix/<Date>/<ConfFileName>/Logs/Listening/
            - after the tester script finished execution will create the flag file at ~<user>/CommsMatrix/<Date>/<ConfFileName>/<BlockName>/Reports/<TesterIP>
    Dependencies:
        execution-user : user who run the script must be either authenticate with public-key or with saved passwrod to the remote machine
        remote-user    : have to be sudo with no passwd
        packages : 
            - nmap-ncat  will be installed on the remote system if not installed
            - at should be installed on the remote system
        services:
            - firewalld service will be stopped if running
            - atd should be running

The Configuration File:
    description: hold multiple [block] to determine the script behavior
    blocks:
        types:
           Default:   hold default attributes "Mode,User/s,ListenDuration" other attributes are now allowed
           <Others>:   hold specific attributes for the block including "Mode,User/s,ListenDuration,IPs,Ports," , block name is one string [a-zA-Z]
        attributes:
            mode independant : can be used within [default] or any other [block]
                Mode: avaliable values
                    uni :   one  way communication matrix test
                    bi  :   two way communication matrix test

                ListentDurationInMinutes: port listen duration applied on tcp and udp ports on listeners
            mode dependant :
                            IPs: the remote ips , bi mode only 
                            TestersIPs:      the remote testerip, uni mode only
                            ListenersIPs:    the remote listenerip , uni mode only
    Notes:
        - block name is one string [a-zA-Z]
        - hashed and empty lines in Configuration File ignored 
        - any attribute does not match documented one ignored
        - configuration are validated for consistency and will exit if it is not consistent
        - spaces not allowd in Configuration File Name
        - IPs/TesterIPs/ListenerIPs:
                - the targeted ips can be mixed ranges/indivudal ips space or newline separated
                - the ip values are validated
                - range can be x.x.x.0-x.x.x.255 (right most)
                - IPS attribute is not allowd in uni mode
                - TesterIPs/ListenersIPS attribute are not allowd in bi mode
